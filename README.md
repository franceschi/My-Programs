Yo Michael!

I'm trying to figure this thing out...

Here is what I discovered:

This is your readme file and I just edited it remotely.
You will view the changes in a "new branch" of your "master branch". 
You will also need to pull request to "merge" if you want to accept this changes I made to your readme file, other wise it will just be a branch and your local README.md stored locally in your machine wont get updated.

How nice is that!
